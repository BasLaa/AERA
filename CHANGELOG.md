* Rename the file Test.cpp to main.cpp .
* Rename the Test project to AERA.
* Rename folders V1.1 and V1.2 to replicode_v1.1 and replicode_v1.2, to distinguish the

AERA Diagnostic Mode v0.1 (2021-11-19)
-------------------------------------

A release optimized to run in "diagnostic time" which is now the default in settings.xml .

* Added example hand-grab-sphere.replicode where all models are coded in the seed.
* Added example hand-grab-sphere-learn.replicode which learns the grab and release models, as well
  as the anti-requirement model where grab fails if the sphere and cube are at the same position.
* Make other bug fixes and enhancements. Please see https://github.com/IIIM-IS/AERA/blob/master/doc/meeting-notes.txt
