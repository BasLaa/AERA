 *
 *  Created by Nathaniel Thurston on 20/12/2009.
 *
 * The computational work of the system is done by the Core.
 * There should be one Core per node, and one Core::Instance per group.
 *
 * The Core and Core::Instance interfaces are not multithread-safe.
 * In particular, it isn't safe to use different Core::Instance interfaces
 * from different threads (this second restriction could be lifted if necessary)
 *
 * Core is internally multi-threaded, controlled by the Asynchronous interface.
