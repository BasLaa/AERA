	//	One instance per input source (e.g. architecture module).
	//	Detects patterns from input sequences: performs as a monitor (goal regression on target).
	//	Input sequences are closed when one of the targets is matched.
	//	This implies overlays - functioning similar to pgms'.
	//	Targets are:
	//		- goals.
	//		- predictions.
	//		- instantiations of high-level patterns (isct and imdl).
	//		- success/failure of goals/predictions.
	//		- reductions performed by high-level patterns (mk.rdx on icst and imdl).
	//	Excludes targets that perform well (e.g. goals that are matched very often, mdls that succeed with a good rate, etc.).
	//	Input objects are abstracted first (BindingMap for a whole sequence), then
	//	internal attention control kicks in in two phases:
	//		- phase 1 - filtering - retain:
	//			- objects sharing common variables, stemming from variables referred to by targets.
	//			- markers (that may not be present in the input sequence) pointing to the objects above.
	//			- all objects and markers referring to the targets and not in the sequence.
	//			- given the level of abstraction of the target, objects from above that are above or at the same level of abstraction
	//			(level of abstraction is lower for objects composing a mdl/cst)
	//			(ex: target=same_pos => discard positions for the objects involved in the target).
	//		- phase 2 - exploitation - detect:
	//			- synchronicity and recurrence (e.g. h1 is a hand, belongs to actor 1: yields a cst; e.g. same position, link, etc.).
	//			- change in state (e.g. |icst -> event -> icst).
	//			- functional values (e.g. y==f(x)) (TODO).
	//			- functional relations (e.g. o1 and o2 in the same relation wrt F as o3 and o3; relation: in or out; e.g. y==F(x), z==f(x) then as above with the constraint y==g(z) or vice-versa) (TODO).

	//		Proxy in usr_operators.dll.
	//		Implementation class in pattern_detector.cpp.
