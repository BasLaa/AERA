	//	R-groups behave like programs: they take inputs from visible/(newly) salient views (depending on their sync mode).
	//	Overlays are built unpon the matching of at least one binder.
	//	Building an overlay means adding bindings (binding: a value per given overlay) to variable objects.
	//	Binding is performed by the _subst function of the executive (see InputLessPGMOverlay::injectProductions()).
	//	The overlays held by controllers are r-group master overlays; these in turn hold r-group overlays.
	//	If the r-group has a parent, one master is built each time some parent overlay fires; otherwise there is only one master.
	//	If the parent overlay that built a master is killed (being too old), said master is removed from the controllers, along with all its overlays;
	//	The views of forward models hold a forward controller that takes inputs from the group the view dwells in.
	//	Predictions are produced with an infinite resilience. They are killed by PMonitors at the time their object is predicted to happen - whether it actually does or not.
