/*
 *  Object.h
 *  rsystem
 *
 *  Created by Nathaniel Thurston on 15/12/2009.
 *
 * The Object interface is used by the System and Core; the implementation
 * is private to the Mem.  The interface is not thread-safe -- callers must
 * arrange that:
 *  * calls to the non-const member functions are serial
 *  * calls to const member functions cannot occur at the same time as
 *    non-const member functions, or while the Mem could be modifying the
 *    underlying object.
 *
 * In practice, this constraint is achieved by:
 *  * The System retains references to objects, but only uses the interface
 *    during function calls from the Mem, and for newly-created objects
 *    not yet known to the Mem.
 *  * The Core retains references to objects, but only uses:
 *    * the const member functions while the Core is resumed (during which
 *      time the Mem is inactive)
 *    * retain() and release() in the final part of Core::suspend(), after all
 *      threads have been suspended and before returning control to the Mem
