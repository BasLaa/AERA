<!--Usage
Init
  base_period: in us.
  reduction_core_count: number of threads processing reduction jobs.
  time_core_count: number of thread processing update jobs.
System
  mdl_inertia_sr_thr: in [0,1].
  mdl_inertia_cnt_thr: in instance count.
  tpx_dsr_thr: in [0,1].
  min_sim_time_horizon: in us.
  max_sim_time_horizon: in us.
  sim_time_horizon: in [0,1]: percentage of (before-now) allocated to simulation.
  tpx_time_horizon: in us.
  perf_sampling_prd: in us.
  float_tolerance: in [0,1].
  time_tolerance: in us.
  primary_thz: time after which states/models that did not match are pushed down to secondary group (models) or sent to oblivion (states); in seconds.
  secondary_thz: time after which states/models that did not match are sent to oblivion; in seconds.
Debug
  Resilience
    ntf_mk_resilience: in upr (i.e. relative to the ntf group).
    goal_pred_success_resilience: in upr (i.e. relative to the ntf group).
  Image
    get_image: yes or no; the image will contain all valid objects after the Mem shuts down.
    decompile_image: yes or no.
    decompile_to_file: yes or no.
    ignore_named_objects: yes or no; if yes, objects provided by the deveoper are not decompiled.
    write_image: yes or no.
    test_image: yes or no (yes: reads back and decompiles).
Run
  run_time: in ms.
  probe_level: any probe set to a level >= this level will not be executed. 0 means no probe will be executed.
  Models
    same as for Debug/Image.
