<!--Usage

base_period: in us.

reduction_core_count: number of threads processing reduction jobs.

time_core_count: number of thread processing update jobs.

notification_resilience: in upr (i.e. relative to the ntf group). For debugging only - otherwise shall be 1.
goal_resilience, assumption_resilience and simulation_resilience: in us.

goal_record_resilience: in us.

float_tolerance: in [0,1].
time_tolerance: in us/1024 (24 bits).

run_time: in ms.

decompile_timestamps: either "relative" or "absolute". When "relative", timestamps are displayed as offsets from mem->start().

probe_level: any probe set to a level >= this level will not be executed. 0 means no probe will be executed.

decompile_image: yes or no.

write_image: yes or no.

test_image: yes or no (yes: reads back and decompiles).
